# Getting started #

You've recently bought a raspberry pi and would like to configure the following:
  * A FTP Server
  * A HTTP Server
  * A camera that takes pictures x seconds, and stored y pictures on the pi's memory at any given time

To get started here you need to get the New Out Of Box Software (NOOBS) OS onto your SD card that you will be using. If you bought the SD from a Raspberry Pi reseller, there is a good chance that NOOBS is already installed on.

If you are unsure of whether or not you have NOOBS installed, do the following:
  * Plug a HMDI cable into the pi and make sure that it is connected to an external screen.
  * Ensure that the SD card is conencted to the Pi.
  * Plug the power cable into the Pi.

The Pi will now start up and if you see a screen saying NOOBS, then your SD card already has NOOBS on it. If nothing happens it means that NOOBS is not on your SD card yet and we will need to get it first.
